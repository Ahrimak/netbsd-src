The <code class="Nm">bootparams</code> file specifies the boot parameters that
  <a class="Xr" href="../html8/diskless.html">diskless(8)</a> clients may
  request when booting over the network. Each client supported by this server
  must have an entry in the <code class="Nm">bootparams</code> file containing
  the servers and pathnames for its <span class="Pa">root</span>, area. It may
  optionally contain <span class="Pa">swap</span>, <span class="Pa">dump</span>,
  and other entry types.
<p class="Pp">Each line in the file (other than comment lines that begin with a
    #) specifies the client name followed by the pathnames that the client may
    request by their logical names. Names are matched in a case-insensitive
    fashion, and may also be wildcarded using shell-style globbing
  characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The components of the line are delimited with blank or tab, and
    may be continued onto multiple lines with a backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
dummy	root=server:/export/dummy/root \
	swap=server:/export/dummy/swap \
	dump=server:/export/dummy/swap \
	gateway=router:255.255.255.0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When the client named &quot;dummy&quot; requests the pathname for
    its logical &quot;root&quot; it will be given server
    &#x201C;<span class="Pa">server</span>&#x201D; and pathname
    &#x201C;<span class="Pa">/export/dummy/root</span>&#x201D; as the response
    to its RPC request.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
netra[1-5]www*	root=server:/export/jumpstart/netra_www
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When any client with a name matching the pattern
    &quot;netra[1-5]www*&quot; requests the pathname for its logical
    &quot;root&quot; it will be given server
    &#x201C;<span class="Pa">server</span>&#x201D; and pathname
    &#x201C;<span class="Pa">/export/jumpstart/netra_www</span>&#x201D; as the
    response to its RPC request. As this example implies, this is useful for
    setting up Jumpstart servers for Sun clients.</p>
