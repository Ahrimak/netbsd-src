<b>pcnfsd</b> is an <small>RPC</small> server that supports Sun ONC clients on
  PC (DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, and other) systems. This page describes version two
  of the <b>pcnfsd</b> server.
<p class="Pp"><b>rpc.pcnfsd</b> may be started from <b>/etc/rc.local</b> or by
    the <b>inetd</b>(8) superdaemon. It reads the configuration file
    <b>/etc/pcnfsd.conf</b> if present, and then services RPC requests directed
    to program number 150001. This release of the <b>pcnfsd</b> daemon supports
    both version 1 and version 2 of the pcnfsd protocol. Consult the
    <b>rpcgen</b> source file <b>pcnfsd.x</b> for details of the protocols.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requests serviced by <b>pcnfsd</b> fall into three categories:
    authentication, printing, and other. Only the authentication and printing
    services have administrative significance.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTHENTICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTHENTICATION">AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
When <b>pcnfsd</b> receives a <b>PCNFSD_AUTH</b> or <b>PCNFSD2_AUTH</b> request,
  it will &quot;log in&quot; the user by validating the username and password
  and returning the corresponding uid, gids, home directory, and umask. If
  <b>pcnfsd</b> was built with the <b>WTMP</b> compile-time option, it will also
  append a record to the <b>wtmp</b>(5) data base. If you do not wish to record
  PC &quot;logins&quot; in this way, you should add a line of the form
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>wtmp off</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
to the <b>/etc/pcnfsd.conf</b> file.

<h1 class="Sh" id="PRINTING"><a class="permalink" href="#PRINTING">PRINTING</a></h1>
<b>pcnfsd</b> supports a printing model based on the use of NFS to transfer the
  actual print data from the client to the server. The client system issues a
  <b>PCNFSD_PR_INIT</b> or <b>PCNFSD2_PR_INIT</b> request, and the server
  returns the path to a spool directory which the client may use and which is
  exported by NFS. <b>pcnfsd</b> creates a subdirectory for each of its clients:
  the parent directory is normally <b>/export/pcnfs</b> and the subdirectory is
  the hostname of the client system. If you wish to use a different parent
  directory, you should add a line of the form
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>spooldir</b> <i>path</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
to the <b>/etc/pcnfsd.conf</b> file.
<p class="Pp">Once a client has mounted the spool directory using NFS and has
    transferred print data to a file in this directory, it will issue a
    <b>PCNFSD_PR_START</b> or <b>PCNFSD2_PR_START</b> request. <b>pcnfsd</b>
    handles this, and most other print-related requests, by constructing a
    command based on the printing services of the server operating system and
    executing the command using the identity of the PC user. Since this involves
    set-user-id privileges, <b>pcnfsd</b> must be run as root.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every print request from the client includes the name of the
    printer which is to be used. In SunOS, this name corresponds to a printer
    definition in the <b>/etc/printcap</b>(5) database. If you wish to define a
    non-standard way of processing print data, you should define a new printer
    and arrange for the client to print to this printer. There are two ways of
    setting up a new printer. The first involves the addition of an entry to
    <b>/etc/printcap</b>(5) and the creation of filters to perform the required
    processing. This is outside the scope of this discussion. In addition,
    <b>pcnfsd</b> includes a mechanism by which you can define virtual printers
    known only to <b>pcnfsd</b> clients. Each printer is defined by a line in
    the <b>/etc/pcnfsd.conf</b> file of the following form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>printer</b> <i>name alias-for command</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<i>name</i> is the name of the printer you want to define. <i>alias-for</i> is
  the name of a &quot;real&quot; printer which corresponds to this printer. For
  example, a request to display the queue for <i>name</i> will be translated
  into the corresponding request for the printer <i>alias-for</i>. If you have
  defined a printer in such a way that there is no &quot;real&quot; printer to
  which it corresponds, use a single &quot;-&quot; for this field. (See the
  definition of the printer <b>test</b> below for an example.) <i>command</i> is
  a command which will be executed whenever a file is printed on <i>name</i>.
  This command is executed by the Bourne shell, <b>/bin/sh</b> using the
  <b>-c</b> option. For complex operations you should construct an executable
  shell program and invoke that in <i>command</i>. Within <i>command</i> the
  following tokens will be replaced:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Token</b></dt>
  <dd><b>Substitution</b></dd>
  <dt><small><b>$FILE</b></small></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the full path name of the print data file. When the command
      has been executed, the file will be unlinked.</dd>
  <dt><small><b>$USER</b></small></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the username of the user logged in to the client system.</dd>
  <dt><small><b>$HOST</b></small></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the host name of the client system.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Consider the following example <b>/etc/pcnfsd.conf</b> file:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">printer rotated lw /usr/local/bin/enscript -2r $FILE
  <br/>
  printer test - /usr/bin/cp $FILE /usr/tmp/$HOST-$USER</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
If a client system prints a job on the printer <b>rotated</b> the utility
  <b>enscript</b> will be invoked to pre-process the file $FILE. In this case,
  the <b>-2r</b> option causes the file to be printed in two-column rotated
  format on the default PostScript&#x00AE; printer. If the client requests a
  list of the print queue for the printer <b>rotated</b> the <b>pcnfsd</b>
  daemon will translate this into a request for a listing for the printer
  <b>lw.</b>
<p class="Pp">The printer <b>test</b> is used only for testing. Any file sent to
    this printer will be copied into <b>/usr/tmp.</b> Any request to list the
    queue, check the status, etc. of printer <b>test</b> will be rejected
    because the <i>alias-for</i> has been specified as &quot;-&quot;.</p>
