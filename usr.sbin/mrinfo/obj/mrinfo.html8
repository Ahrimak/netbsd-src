mrinfo - Displays configuration info from a multicast router

<i>mrinfo</i> attempts to display the configuration information from the
  multicast router <i>multicast_router.</i>
<p class="Pp"><i>mrinfo</i> uses the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to the specified
    multicast router. If this multicast router responds, the version number and
    a list of their neighboring multicast router addresses is part of that
    response. If the responding router has a recent multicast version number,
    then <i>mrinfo</i> requests additional information such as metrics,
    thresholds, and flags from the multicast router. Once the specified
    multicast router responds, the configuration is displayed to the standard
    output.

&quot;-d&quot; option sets the debug level. When the debug level is greater than
  the default value of 0, addition debugging messages are printed. Regardless of
  the debug level, an error condition, will always write an error message and
  will cause <i>mrinfo</i> to terminate. Non-zero debug levels have the
  following effects:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>level 1</dt>
  <dd>packet warnings are printed to stderr.</dd>
  <dt>level 2</dt>
  <dd>all level 1 messages plus notifications down networks are printed to
      stderr.</dd>
  <dt>level 3</dt>
  <dd>all level 2 messages plus notifications of all packet timeouts are printed
      to stderr.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-r retry_count&quot; sets the neighbor query retry limit.
    Default is 3 retry.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-t timeout_count&quot; sets the number of seconds to wait
    for a neighbor query reply. Default timeout is 4 seconds.</p>

    queried router is displayed, followed by the IP and name of the neighbor. In
    square brackets the metric (cost of connection), the threshold (multicast
    ttl) is displayed. If the queried multicast router has a newer version
    number, the type (tunnel, srcrt) and status (disabled, down) of the
    connection is displayed.</p>
