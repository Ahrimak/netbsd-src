<i>map-mbone</i> attempts to display all multicast routers that are reachable
  from the multicast <i>starting_router.</i> If not specified on the command
  line, the default multicast <i>starting_router</i> is the localhost.
<p class="Pp"><i>map-mbone</i> traverses neighboring multicast routers by
    sending the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to the multicast starting_router. If
    this multicast router responds, the version number and a list of their
    neighboring multicast router addresses is part of that response. If the
    responding router has recent multicast version number, then <i>map-mbone</i>
    requests additional information such as metrics, thresholds, and flags from
    the multicast router. For each new occurrence of neighboring multicast
    router in the reply and provided the flooding option has been selected, then
    <i>map-mbone</i> asks each of this multicast router for a list of neighbors.
    This search for unique routers will continue until no new neighboring
    multicast routers are reported.

&quot;-d&quot; option sets the debug level. When the debug level is greater than
  the default value of 0, addition debugging messages are printed. Regardless of
  the debug level, an error condition, will always write an error message and
  will cause <i>map-mbone</i> to terminate. Non-zero debug levels have the
  following effects:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>level 1</dt>
  <dd>packet warnings are printed to stderr.</dd>
  <dt>level 2</dt>
  <dd>all level 1 messages plus notifications down networks are printed to
      stderr.</dd>
  <dt>level 3</dt>
  <dd>all level 2 messages plus notifications of all packet timeouts are printed
      to stderr.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-f&quot; option sets flooding option. Flooding allows the
    recursive search of neighboring multicast routers and is enable by default
    when starting_router is not used.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-g&quot; option sets graphing in GraphEd format.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-n&quot; option disables the DNS lookup for the multicast
    routers names.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-r retry_count&quot; sets the neighbor query retry limit.
    Default is 1 retry.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-t timeout_count&quot; sets the number of seconds to wait
    for a neighbor query reply before retrying. Default timeout is 2
  seconds.</p>
