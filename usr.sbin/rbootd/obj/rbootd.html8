The <code class="Nm">rbootd</code> utility services boot requests from
  Hewlett-Packard workstations over a local area network. All boot files must
  reside in the boot file directory; further, if a client supplies path
  information in its boot request, it will be silently stripped away before
  processing. By default, <code class="Nm">rbootd</code> only responds to
  requests from machines listed in its configuration file. If the client doesn't
  supply a file name (HPPA series machines don't), the first one listed for this
  machine will be supplied.
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl" id="a">-a</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Respond to boot requests from any machine. The configuration file is
      ignored if this option is specified.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl" id="d">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Run <code class="Nm">rbootd</code> in debug mode. Packets sent and
      received are displayed to the terminal.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl" id="i">-i</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">interface</var></dt>
  <dd>Service boot requests on specified interface. If unspecified,
      <code class="Nm">rbootd</code> searches the system interface list for the
      lowest numbered, configured ``up'' interface (excluding loopback). Ties
      are broken by choosing the earliest match.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Specifying <var class="Ar">config_file</var> on the command line
    causes <code class="Nm">rbootd</code> to use a different configuration file
    from the default.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration file is a text file where each line describes a
    particular machine. A line must start with a machine's Ethernet address
    followed by an optional list of boot file names. An Ethernet address is
    specified in hexadecimal with each of its six octets separated by a colon.
    The boot file names come from the boot file directory. The ethernet address
    and boot file(s) must be separated by white-space and/or comma characters. A
    pound sign causes the remainder of a line to be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a sample configuration file:</p>
<table class="Bl-column">
  <tr>
    <td>#</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td># ethernet addr</td>
    <td>boot file(s)</td>
    <td>comments</td>

<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">rbootd</code> logs status and error messages via
    <a class="Xr" href="../html3/syslog.html">syslog(3)</a>. A startup message
    is always logged, and in the case of fatal errors (or deadly signals) a
    message is logged announcing the server's termination. In general, a
    non-fatal error is handled by ignoring the event that caused it (e.g. an
    invalid Ethernet address in the config file causes that line to be
    invalidated).</p>
<p class="Pp">The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the
    server process using the <a class="Xr" href="../html1/kill.html">kill(1)</a>
