Once upon time, the only Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software easily available was
  &#x201C;sendmail&#x201D;. This famous MTA was written by <span class="An">Eric
  Allman</span> and first appeared in <span class="Ux">4.1BSD</span>. The legacy
  of this MTA affected most Mail User Agents (MUAs) such as
  <a class="Xr" href="../html1/mail.html">mail(1)</a>; the path and calling
  conventions expected by &#x201C;sendmail&#x201D; were compiled in.
<p class="Pp">But times changed. On a modern <span class="Ux">NetBSD</span>
    system, the administrator may wish to use one of several available MTAs.</p>
<p class="Pp">It would be difficult to modify all MUA software typically
    available on a system, so most of the authors of alternative MTAs have
    written their front end message submission programs that may appear in the
    place of <span class="Pa">/usr/sbin/sendmail</span>, but still follow the
    same calling conventions as &#x201C;sendmail&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &#x201C;sendmail&#x201D; MTA also typically has aliases named
    <a class="Xr" href="../html1/mailq.html">mailq(1)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../html1/newaliases.html">newaliases(1)</a> linked to
    it. The program knows to behave differently when its
    <var class="Va">argv[0]</var> is &#x201C;mailq&#x201D; or
    &#x201C;newaliases&#x201D; and behaves appropriately. Typically, replacement
    MTAs provide similar functionality, either through a program that also
    switches behavior based on calling name, or through a set of programs that
    provide similar functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although having replacement programs that plug replace
    &#x201C;sendmail&#x201D; helps in installing alternative MTAs, it
    essentially makes the configuration of the system depend on hand installing
    new programs in <span class="Pa">/usr</span>. This leads to configuration
    problems for many administrators, since they may wish to install a new MTA
    without altering the system provided <span class="Pa">/usr</span>. (This may
    be, for example, to avoid having upgrade problems when a new version of the
    system is installed over the old.) They may also have a shared
    <span class="Pa">/usr</span> among several machines, and may wish to avoid
    placing implicit configuration information in a read-only
    <span class="Pa">/usr</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">mailwrapper</code> program is designed to
    replace <span class="Pa">/usr/sbin/sendmail</span> and to invoke an
    appropriate MTA based on configuration information placed in
    <span class="Pa">/etc/mailer.conf</span>. This permits the administrator to
    configure which MTA is to be invoked on the system at run time.</p>

Configuration for <code class="Nm">mailwrapper</code> is kept in
  <span class="Pa">/etc/mailer.conf</span>.
  <span class="Pa">/usr/sbin/sendmail</span> is typically set up as a symlink to
  <code class="Nm">mailwrapper</code> which is not usually invoked on its own.

The entire reason this program exists is a crock. Instead, a command for how to
  submit mail should be standardized, and all the &#x201C;behave differently if
  invoked with a different name&#x201D; behavior of things like
  <a class="Xr" href="../html1/mailq.html">mailq(1)</a> should go away.
