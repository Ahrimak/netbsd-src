With an argument naming an existing <var class="Ar">file</var>,
  <code class="Nm">accton</code> causes system accounting information for every
  process executed to be placed at the end of the file. If no argument is given,
  accounting is turned off.
<p class="Pp">The default accounting file is
    <span class="Pa">/var/account/acct</span>. Typically, accounting is enabled
    by rc scripts during the boot process. In <span class="Ux">NetBSD</span>,
    one may enable accounting by setting the variable &#x201C;accounting&#x201D;
    to &#x201C;YES&#x201D; in <span class="Pa">/etc/rc.conf</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, traditionally, the system accounting log file can not
    be rotated cleanly by
    <a class="Xr" href="../html8/newsyslog.html">newsyslog(8)</a>. Instead, a
    default installation of <span class="Ux">NetBSD</span> rotates
    <span class="Pa">/var/account/acct</span> using the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/daily</span> script.</p>
