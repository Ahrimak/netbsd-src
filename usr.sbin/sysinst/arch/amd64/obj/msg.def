{NetBSD/amd64 10.99.10

This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard
disk, or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work. 
In the following menus type the reference letter (a, b, c, ...) to
select an item, or type CTRL+N/CTRL+P to select the next/previous item. 
The arrow keys and Page-up/Page-down may also work. 
Activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

}

message installusure
{You have chosen to install NetBSD on your hard disk.  This will change
information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  This procedure will do the following things:
	a) Partition your disk
	b) Create new BSD file systems
	c) Load and install distribution sets
	d) Some initial system configuration

(After you enter the partition information but before your disk is
changed, you will have the opportunity to quit this procedure.)

`upgrade' if you want those options.)  You should have already done an

to your choice, but aligned to cylinder boundaries.
Choosing sectors will allow you to more accurately specify
the sizes. On most disks, there is little to gain from
cylinder alignment.  On very old disks, it is most efficient
to choose partition sizes that are exact multiples of your actual
cylinder size.

message not_enough_entropy
{This system seems to lack a cryptographically strong pseudo random
number generator. There is not enough entropy available to create secure
keys (e.g. ssh host keys). 
 
If you plan to use this installation for production work and will
for example have ssh host keys generated, we strongly advise to complete
the entropy setup now! 
 
You may use random data generated on another computer and load it
here, or you could enter random characters manually. 
 
If you have a USB random number device, connect it now and select
the "Re-test" option.}
